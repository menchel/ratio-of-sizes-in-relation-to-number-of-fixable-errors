# ratio-of-sizes-in-relation-to-number-of-fixable-errors

This is a python code for creating a graph of the ratio-of-sizes-in-relation-to-number-of-fixable-errors

In order to run, you enter the n values needed, and then the deltas to check.

For example:
Enter vector size n 10
Enter delta 1
Enter maximum t value 4
Enter window sizes (comma separated): 2,4,6,8,10

In the end, the graph will be saved as plot_multiple_l_values.png

NOTE: you need the matplotlib libary in order to run this code.
